Robot Factory

Example I threw together for a Distributed Programming assignment. Demonstrates knowledge of JINI and Javaspaces. All files that are required to run the program should be included in the repository. Source code shows how to interact with Javaspaces.

Parts are loaded in from configuration files. Part files are also loaded from a seperate configuration file. More parts can be added as seen fit, so long as they are listed in hte parts config file.

Future Work: Replace parts config file with folder, so that files don't have to be listed to be found. Iterate over all files in folder.

Installation:
1. Copy the javaspace folder to C:/
	You can use a different folder if you want for your Javaspaces, but if you do you will need to alter the scripts.
2. Run the scripts in order 1-2-3 to start the Javaspace servers.
3. Run the Bicycle or Robot factory.
